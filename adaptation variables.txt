flowNetFlag[n][f] 				flag is 1 (or more) when for any earlier time slot (+ forward looking range), this combination existed in the initial schedule
activeFlow[f]					array over active flows, containing the original indices of the active flows activeFlow[f] = original index of f
activeFlowBool					flag is 1 when flow is active in this time slot
comb[f]	= assigned Network		Is a combination: this is an an array over flows, saying to which network it is assigned

Balancer pick???	sets dest. what is dest???	assigns 
Balancer pickFlowId	?? same
mQ[f]				??? 
prior[f]			???
max[f]
dest[f]				OUTPUT!! 

partNum[n] 		number of active flows using this network

getMax			maximum number of tokens to allocate =  average max throughput OR number of tokens
getmQ			average minimum throughput value. 				AdaptScheduler: when not available, then use nofTokens / (deadline-start time)?
DataSize		number of tokens of a flow		
prior			not used, all equal. Former user weight.		AdaptScheduler. Use flowCriticality Heuristic?

cap				capacity of the network in this time slot


Questions: 

What is netIndex in Individual.mutate(boolean random, int netIndex), why not using the other mutate ?
Algorithm mutate loop????????? 
	Does not loop through genes? - variable i is not used. 
	constOn - not used
Individual mutate loop i < 100???


Changes: 
Tournament selection: Do not use the same Individual twice in a random tournament set. Done. Correct?

Individual.mutate: mutate each gene(flow) with probability 1/populationSize instead of selecting one flow to change.
